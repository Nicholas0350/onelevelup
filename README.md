This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Problem
 
Want content generated through markdown files using Nextjs to serve react app. 

Create a new markdown file that contains content & imagesfor a  blog post from the creation of this markdown file.
A new blog post will be listed on the homepage of website and clicking on it will lead us to a page where we can read that specific blog post in full.

- Create a project find a way to read and parse markdown files, because Next.js does not provide a way out of the box. 

- Set up dynamic routing so that a unique URL is automatically generated for each new blog post. 
- create a single blog page component that renders out a blog from the data stored in a given markdown file. 
- Set dynamic URLâ€™s to go to this page component, which is configured to extract the unique part of the dynamic URL, the query parameter, and use this information to render out a specific markdown file that corresponds to the blog-post that the user just clicked on.
