If you guys have read the secrets book, what you probably got from that is that it was a it was a business book that was applied to gyms, right? rather than a a gym book that just was about gym stuff. Right? And so that's kind of what my hope is here.

how to fill your financial services business using other people's money.

So one of the smartest things about learning the game of business, for me has been learning to leverage other people's money.

business frameworks that actually work, so this is not hacks, this is stuff that actually works in the real world.

## Number one

- if you're a regulated financial services company that is currently below $100,000 a month, this will help you establish your first reliable acquisition channel.
- this will help you get that first acquisition channel in a reliable fashion.

if you can't reliably acquire clients, if you have off months and months, you haven't checked this box yet,

sometimes they come in sometimes you don't or it's not reliable.

So like, we wouldn't be able to scale and grow and continue to do what we do if we weren't reliable in our acquisition.

# And so the first thing you have to do is get a reliable channel.

- And now, if you're over $100,000 a month, then the goal is to establish your next reliable channel. Alright, that's kind of the goal there is.

Okay, you've got one, but how do we scale from there? Okay, so this may be your current acquisition setup. The next five days is these presentations, and then you will have your next acquisition channel is a fun, fun tidbit.

How many different acquisition channels do you think there are?

- So like Facebook ads
- Cold Calling would be an acquisition channel.
- cold email would be an acquisition channel.
- Cold dms would be an acquisition channel.
- email content would be an acquisition channel.
- podcast would be an acquisition channel,

how many different acquisition channels?

Do you think we actually use a gym? Watch? Go ahead, throw those in the chat from zero? Well, if you're if you're here, right now, then you can count at least one, right? zero to, you know, 100 or wherever you want. So as you're answering that, I want you to think right now,
how many of those are you using? And how many of those are reliable, that you know, every month, how many you're going to get for each of those channels?

Alright, so that's what we're here to do. And I'm not gonna say we're gonna help you build every one of them. What I'm going to show you is the different ones that we use, and which ones are working best right now.

Complist has five different advertising platforms. 22 different offer structures, 1300 plus ads, I got this from our agency site, we spent $2 million on advertising for gyms. To get clients. That's not our marketing. That's not our marketing that we spent, that's b2c, that's to get customers

There are two ways to grow a business period,

- number one, get more customers.
- Number two, make the customers worth more.

That is it. That's all there is. And if you think about the things that you do in your business every day, if you can't directly tie what you were doing to either getting more customers or making the customers you have worth more than you should cease to do it. Right, because everything you have is either directly or indirectly tied to one of those two goals.

fundamentally, from a from a brain standpoint, when you're analysing a business, when I analyse the business,

# Why Are we Here

## One free leads, the process and the frameworks to get leads for free with zero outside capital

## Two is get more leads? framework the six different places that we look for to get leads.

## Three how to take those lead flows and turn them into sales.

A process now, I'll show you what we're doing right now. That's working very well. The reason Jim Lynch guys were able to sell 2k 3k plus packages,

## Four how to make them worth more six ways of doing it. Everything's flows from those six ways. So you look at your, your own business with this filters and think, Okay, I have to apply these six frameworks to the way that I treat customers so that I can increase the LTV of those customers.

And then finally, you're gonna have ways of getting free leads, ways of getting more leads, ways of closing more deals, making them worth more.

## day five, put all the pieces together. So you can do them in the right sequence,

- Day 1 client financed acquisition break down that kind of some of the newer, newer thoughts that we have around this process because it continues to evolve,

- Day 2 Six client sources show you the strategies that are working right now and how you can implement them in your business.

- Day 3, how to sell more for more. how do you sell more people at higher prices, right, higher conversion rates at higher prices.

- Day four and six ways to increase lifetime gross profit are the six ways of doing it. And I'll walk you through each one of them and tactically how you can do it in your own business right now.

- Day five, I'll show you how to execute on those things.

most companies lose money getting customers, and that is what if you play the game the right way, you can not have to do that. I know, you might not be able to see this, this little dude, I'm going to break down every aspect of it right now. So if you have less money than your competition, which most of you are listening, this do have less money than your competition, or you feel like you spend too much to acquire customers. This is for you. This is the problem if you're suffering from this, and that's what I'm about to solve. Alright, so quick question for everyone. I told you this is gonna be interactive. How much does it cost?

How much does it cost LA fitness suite for fitness or goals? To acquire $39 month membership? On average? Put it in the put in the comments. Tell me how much do you think it costs them to acquire customer? Alright, dropping in? At least fitness goals? 24 Hour Fitness? How much do you think it costs them to acquire customer? $150? Alright, so between the cost of advertising, marketing and their marketing team, the sales salaries, sales commissions, it costs him $150 per new membership at $39 per month.

They put $150 in and they get $39? Yeah, well, that's not very profitable. But guess what? They're killing. So how are they able to do this? And how can we compete as small businesses you might not have, you know, four or five?

# Gross Margin

## what do you think their gross margin is on a membership?

gross margin is the direct cost of fulfilment.
if I'm selling something for $100, and it cost me $10, to sell my gross margin is 90. Alright, so what is the gross margin percentage? On one of their memberships? All right, let me know what you think please do it in the comments right now. Just hop on, engage. Alright, and then we'll walk through the next one. Okay. The answer is 85%. So if you take out the cost of cleaning the facility, maintaining the equipment, breaking stuff, the amenities, the insurance, all of those aspects, that is the direct cost to fulfilling their services, they do it an equipment, leasing facility, basically, you you, you just leased the facility from them. So the direct costs of facility is what people are paying for. In most of the micro gyms, what people are paying for is not use it to the facility, but they're paying for services, which is why you need to believe looking at your payroll per session to figure out your cost of goods sold is alright, but for these guys, it's 85%. Plus, don't worry, I'm building to a point here.

# Payback Period

## assuming someone gets 39 only gets a $39 month membership? How long does it take them to make back the $150?

## How long does it take them to make the money back? This is called payback period. How long does it take for them to make it back

You take the $39, you multiply it by the gross margin. So you know how much juice there is how much chop there is leftover at the end of this process. So there's $33 of gross profit per membership. They take the $150 divided by the gross profit. And you now know it takes four and a half months for them to get to breakeven, right, that's the payback period, four and a half months. So you put $100 in, it takes you four and a half months to get it back.

And this is the piece that a lot of you guys are missing in your marketing, you get it in your gut, because on some level you're like, I mean, I spent $2,000 and I make $2,000 back for some reason my bank account doesn't even out that way. That's because you have costs of fulfilment that you're not, you're not taking into consideration, right cost you money, not only to acquire the customers, but to fulfil on the things you just sold. Right. I'm going to show you the equation in a second that solves this problem for you. But that's fundamentally why your marketing that you do right now is not working the way you want it to work.

So who here question for everyone who here could market for four and a half months straight? As in whatever you're spending right now in marketing, you've just spent it this month we spent next month next month, next month and the month after that? You spend it straight before getting your money back who here Just say yes or no Y or N in the in the comments wire in if right now. You could spend four and a half months marketing spending money, the same amount of money spent right now without making money back. Who could do that? Probably not many of you, right? And so, right now, if the big box gyms wanted to grow while profiting,

how much would they need to collect in the first 30 days to not meet a marketing budget? this is called 30. Day cash.

This is the amount of money you collect in gross profit from a customer in the first 30 days.

So how much would they need to collect in the first 30 days in gross profit in order for them to not need a marketing budget? If you answer this $155 because you're trying to account, you're close, you're halfway there, you're not there, but you're halfway there. It's actually two times that it's $311.70. Alright, and if that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry. I'm going to cover that. So is anyone have a question about how to do that? How do you do that? Cuz you're like, Okay, how do I do that? Fantastic. Pay attention, the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to do that. That is the game I've built everything I have on. Alright, this, like, I would like you to pay more just proportionate attention to this part of the presentation. Because this is this is if you understand this, you'll never have to pay money to a car customer.

this is why I haven't had funding in any of the businesses I've had. This is why you know, we own 100% of all all the businesses so that we can, we can make these types of moves.

_cost to acquire a customer CAC_. If you hear me talk about this in the remaining days, this is what it comes from. It's all the costs required to acquire a new customer advertising payroll, payroll media buyer creative team software that you have to use to make the advertising sales commissions, sales, salaries, etc. All of that goes into cost of acquisition,

_cost of goods sold or COGS_. That's the direct cost of fulfilling or delivering your products and services. So for many of you, if you have, you know, 40 sessions a week, and you have four months, four weeks in a month, roughly right, got 160 sessions a month.

if your payroll is $10,000, then it's $10,000 divided by 160. That's your direct cost to fulfilling sessions right per session, you have to know that that

_gross profit_. This is the amount of money left over after the direct cost of filling what you sell ie after you pay your cost of goods sold, you have your gross profit, that's what's left over, that doesn't mean everything else, it doesn't mean your front desk grow, it doesn't mean your rent does any of that stuff. This is just the direct cost of fullfilling what you sell. If I were selling sandwiches, it's going to be the just the cost of bread and meat.

And the box that I that I give it to somebody, it's not going to be the cost of the advertising, it's not gonna be the cost of the rent. It's the it's the actual cost of goods, right? So the gross profit

_Payback Period_. This is one that most people don't talk about what you need to be asking this question whenever you start a new acquisition channel, alright, so the period of time it takes a business to receive the gross profits in excess of CAC. So what that means is, if, if it costs me $100, to get a customer, how soon can I make $100 in profit off that customer.

which leads naturally, the last and probably most important, dynamic is between these three things.

First, _profit payback period 30 to cash_ is the amount of gross profit I extract in the first 30 days. The reason this is so important for small business owners like us, and I define small business owners is anyone has 100 employees or less is that most businesses that are small don't have a lot of cash on hand. And so you can use credit cards to fuel your own growth.

- And as long as you make more than it costs to acquire the customer, and the cost to fulfil the customer in that 30 day period, you can pay back your credit card and end up with a free customer at the end. That's the game.

So these are the variables what I just showed you that make or break your gym. This is it, this is how it works. And this equation, feel free to screenshot it. This equation is made me all of the wealth that I have. Now it looks complicated, but I'm gonna read it to you like English, okay, means I have to generate more gross profit in the first 30 days of running an advertisement. Then it costs me to acquire customer and fulfil that customer times two, which means I have to be able to in the first 30 days, get customer fulfil that customer and then get another customer and fill that customer off the gross profit I make on one customer.

Reason that's so important is because if you can achieve this, it means you no longer have an advertising budget. It means that you can do whatever the fuck you want. Because you have the you're in control and you've built a machine that allows you to generate cash flow off of eyeballs reinvest the cash as you're getting new customers and forever eliminates capital as a restraint on your business.

Okay, this is what allows us small non money back founders to outspend better funded competitors, right? It evens the competitive playing field, and it eliminates the need for marketing budgets.

This is what it looks like in real life, you pay 100 bucks, you borrow $100 for a credit card, alright, you get two customers for 50 bucks a pop, that's the deal, right? That make sense. From there, you get $600 per per start total between the two. So you're getting $300 each, right? So 300 times to you, man, extra $600. So you spent 100, you get 600. Okay, cool. But now each customer cost you $50 to fulfil times two, which means minus $100. Fantastic. So now at the end of the month, you have $400 and to customers that you can continue to sell, and you've paid off your original $200 or your $100 of debt.

This is how you generate buckets of cash flow. So let me show you this visually, I told you, I spent a lot of time on the slide. So here's your debt, Here's your money. And that's the amount of customers you have right now. So let's say you spend $100 in ADS. From there, oops, there we go. You get eyeballs. Because the platform serves your ads. From there, you get clicks. From there, you get opt ins from there, you get scheduled appointments from there, you get people to show from there, you get sales, alright, there's the two people or two new customers that $600 total 300 300. All right, $100 goes to cost of fulfilment. That means how much it costs us to fulfil the customer. From there, we repay another $100 back to the credit card. And then boom, we put $400 in our bank account.

That's how this works. Right? That's the visual explanation of how the math in the process of confidence acquisition works. Alright, and so after the dust settles, what this means is, you now have two customers $400.00 debt, and you can play the game again. And that's the that's the goal, right. And so here's what I want you to make sure like you're writing down you're taking your notes on this is that this works with any acquisition channel, I'm going to show you a different example right now. I'm going to show you a bunch of acquisition channels tomorrow. But just as an example, this is this is a different and this is from an outbound channel. This means if you're doing outreach,

Alright, so the first one was ads, this one is outreach.

you borrow $200 from a credit card, you spend $200. In labour, as in someone works for you, they do something they do outreach, they do dm send you emails to do cocoa to do whatever, right, you have labour, that's what you're buying.

From there, you get reach out as a result of that labour, that's basically a way of getting eyeballs, but through different mechanisms.

From there, you're gonna get open rates on either DMS or texts, or phone calls or emails, whatever it is, you're gonna get opens from there, you get a certain amount of people that are gonna reply. And then from there, you get the same as scheduled showed sold, right, and then boom, in this instance, let's see, we got four customers from our original $200 of labour. So it might cost let's say, 60 bucks a day, or 70 bucks a day, to pay someone to do this for you. And for three days, they do outreach attempts, in over three days, they're able to get you, you know, four customers, because they sent you you know, three phone calls a day and you close to right, and that gives you 12 $100 $400 to fulfil the film, you repay the $200 in debt, and then boom, $600 gets sent to your bank account. And now you have $1,000 beautifully, you have no debt. And your first round of client financed acquisition, you got two customers, your second round of client financed acquisition, you got four customers.

And if you're following along you notice we never risked your own capital, we risk other people's money, you risk begging credit card, whatever, we can use other people's money to fund the growth.

And realistically, it's not even their money that we're using. We're using the client's money. That's why it's called client finance acquisition.

And so each customer comes inside of it with two things.

It comes with the amount of money that cost to acquire them:

Hey, you pick up whatever source $100 to acquire me. So here's 100 for that. And by the way, I'm going to need you some time from your from your team. So here's some money for that.

And

But you know what, you're gonna need more money to go get more customers, okay? Have you breakeven now, so here's more money, so you can go acquire that guy, and here's more money so you can spend to fulfil on that. And if you're playing this, right, you can do this customer, the next customer and still have profit leftover.

And that's how you profit while you grow.

That's how we got 36 to 136. So if you think about that, that means you can put $1,000 in and get 36,000 back, you take 36,000 put it in and get 900,000 back, but 900,000 and get 27 million back, right or more than whatever the math is right? 3040 whatever it is, right? That is the machine that we're going over. It's these frameworks that built that

That's how I opened six teams off cashflow. In three years, each of these gyms, I was able to open it full capacity from day one, not using my own money. That was the cool part about this, I would put five grand in a bank account. And by the time the gym was open, 30 days later, I already had it at full capacity. I had 100,000 plus in the bank account, even though was a new business. And I had, you know, 150 shorter customers that were ready, renew in six weeks, right need to continuity. And so after that period of time, I was able to bank all that money,

I was only getting paid to open gyms.

That's the game. All right. So this is also how the average gym that is used this strategy, or that uses, excuse me, uses this strategy is able to add 80 $900 per month in profit to their facility. All right, that's the average. Also how they increase their average by $239,000 per year.

It's also you net 67, New eftps within a year, this is the process, right. And you can do this if you don't have a lot of money right now. Or rather, especially if you don't have a lot of money right now.

Because if you play the game the right way, you don't need it. So I don't know if you guys have seen this, I don't have a slide for this. But if you guys have seen undercover billionaire, it's a show that I'm that I think is really cool. And I always like to think about what would I do if I just start all over again, right where I do? Well, what they do is they give you a pickup truck and $100 they save to build a million dollar business in 90 days. So how are you going to get from $100 to a million dollars, which is 183k a month, in 90 days, we're gonna have to get a hell of a better return on your advertising. Right, then then two to one and three to one, you have to play from game, right. And so this is where understanding the framework that I just walked through by using other people's money by using the financing from institutions, which all of us have access to all of us have access to credit cards for 30 days, so everyone will front you money. On top of that clients will frame the money before you fulfil. And believe it or not employees also front you, their labour before even have to pay. It's if you think about this, from a cash flow perspective, you can grab money from a credit card, right? Wait 30 days, you can spend that money. And as long as you make enough to cover the card from your clients, you can collect that cash during the next period of time your employees are fulfilling on that promise.

And then only after that point, you'd have to pay cash flow out to your customers, sorry, to your, to your employees to cover the cost here. So first we grab money from institutions, then we then we turn that and flip that into money from customers.

And then we use our services that we're selling, we're arbitrage how much we can buy labour from a marketplace, train the labour and then sell that labour in a new marketplace that we've defined. And then pay for that. And during that process, if you put the pieces together correctly, you should be able to get new customers for free, cover the cost of fulfilment take cash, put it in your pocket, and at the end of the month, have more customers than you had more money than you had, and have a new wave and have a whole new group of people that you can continue to sell.

And so if you think about it for your own business, this is where getting cash upfront is really important. This is we're having initiation fees is really important. This is where selling to go is really important. This is worth selling supplements and other retail packages right as someone walks in and that first two days three days is so important as you can cash flow the acquisition.

So someone came in, let's say, for example, and did a free trial at my gym. I'm not saying you should run that offer. I'm saying if I did, and I somehow to make money back from them, right? I might sell a free trial, do a free session of something, try and upsell them a new service, set up nutrition appointment, upsell the two $300 supplements that covers the acquisition costs, the higher service levels and cash flows the rest of the service, I need to fulfil them and gives me enough money to get the next customer. But the thing is, is no one's thinking about their businesses that way, except for the business guys.

And so that's why this presentation is not about running a gym. It's about running a business, and we're applying it to gyms. I hope you guys are cool with that. Is that all right? I feel you guys are probably tired of seeing every new nicknack you know, and I apologise because candidly, I've built half the fucking gears on your newsfeed. So I'm sorry for that. Um, but I say that to say I'm sure on some level you're kind of tired of, of just like the hacks and the tips and tricks. Because reality is the things that are going to grow your gym are things that are unchanging, their principles, right? If you want your gym to be here in a year, or be here in three years, for those of you who who weathered COVID you already know that it's not about that there's not one trick or one hack that got your gym to survive. It was a lot of real things. It was real community. It was real relationships, real touchpoints whose proper pricing was proper fulfilment and putting the services in place at the right margins. So obviously we talk about this stuff. I have some of that stuff in my book. But I'll continue on sorry for the for the Hope you guys are good with that, I get a little bit passionate about this stuff because I care. And I just want everyone to do authy. I mean, and so if you can execute clarify this acquisition, and you do this properly, this is the point, I want you to realise, you can do this until your operations break. Alright, so think about this, if you have an unlimited front end, you're not actually gonna have an unlimited front end, because at some point, your operations itself will break, you won't be able to onboard the number of customers fast enough, right. And so what's going to happen is, it's going to lean on your next weakness, which for most of you,

# Operating a financial services business
